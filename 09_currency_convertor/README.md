# Currency Convertor

In this project we create a real time currency convertor which uses an API to fetch the current exchange rates and converts one currency to another.

Here we learned about:
- Building custom hooks
- useId() hook
- Real world uses of components
- Building swap functionalities
- Optimizing the code

The app looks like this:
